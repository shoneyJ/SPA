# Single Page application using vanilla JavaScript, nodejs express

---

Using this [Referrence](https://dev.to/dcodeyt/building-a-single-page-app-without-frameworks-hl9 "Dev To") I am developing a single page application without using a view engine.


The concepts I will be covering in it will be

1. RESTfull api using node js express.
2. Use of vanilla JavaScript.
3. ES6 (promise,async)
4. JavaScript multi- threaded Event loop
